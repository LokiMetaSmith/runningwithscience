# 2025 Year-End Update: Hardware, Clusters, and Creative Frontiers

**Date:** December 18, 2025  
**Location:** Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

As 2025 draws to a close, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the year’s work, the ventures we’ve launched, and the technical rabbit holes I’ve happily fallen down. It’s been a year of building foundations—both literal and digital—across hardware engineering, decentralized systems, and non-profit initiatives.

Here is a look at what I’ve been up to and where we are heading in 2026.

## 🚀 Ventures & Business Updates

This year has been defined by three key pillars in my professional life:

*   **Splotch Creative LLC:** Continuing to drive creative and technical solutions as Co-Owner.
*   **Idea Forge Foundation:** I’m proud to serve as President of this non-profit. We are currently in the process of seeking federal grant funding (via grants.gov) to further our mission of supporting innovation.
*   **WeFlourish:** My newest venture. We are currently in the structuring phase—finalizing the pitch deck and LLC operating agreement with my two co-founders. Expect to hear more about this soon.

On the administrative front, I am wrapping up a few loose ends from the year, including resolving the contract dispute regarding "The Cicada" art installation. Looking forward, I’m excited to confirm my attendance for **ETHDenver 2025**, where I’ll be diving into the "Maker Track" for some serious hardware hacking.

## 🛠️ The Lab: Hardware & Cluster Computing

The home lab has evolved significantly this year. My focus has been on building resilient, high-performance systems for AI and general compute.

### The "Llama-Cluster"
I’ve been developing a custom compute cluster using **Ansible** for deployment. The stack is built on **Consul** and **Nomad**, featuring custom "power-agent" services to manage workloads efficiently.

### AI Hardware Acceleration
A major part of my research has been optimizing for AMD platforms:
*   **ROCm & Debugging:** Deep diving into the AMD ROCm platform and debugging software compilation for AMD GPUs.
*   **Speedups:** Investigating **MXFP4** (low-precision floating-point) to accelerate ML training.
*   **Edge AI:** Exploring the utility of the **AMD Quark NPU** for efficient, low-power inference.

### Electronics Engineering
*   **ESP32-S3 Refactor:** I’m currently refactoring a Teensy-based project into C++ for the ESP32-S3 microcontroller to take advantage of its wireless capabilities and dual-core architecture.
*   **Advanced Testing:** conducting Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) tests on electrochemical cells using NanoVNAs and oscilloscopes.

## 🤖 Robotics & Automation

### NanoBot
The "nanochat" project is evolving. I’m transforming it into a full-fledged robotics platform, the **NanoBot**, leveraging lightweight, multi-modal vision models like DeepSeek-OCR and Janus-style architectures to give it sight and understanding.

### Industrial Applications
I’ve also been conducting a feasibility study for a robotic surface preparation and painting system designed specifically for water towers—a challenging environment that is ripe for automation.

## 🧪 Unconventional & Biological Computing

Beyond silicon, I’ve been exploring the edges of computing substrates:

*   **Bio-Memristors:** Researching the potential of SCOBY and mycelium-based neural networks.
*   **Liquid Crystals:** Exploring the physics of cholesteric textures in liquid crystals for analog optical computing.
*   **Sustainable Systems:** On the practical side, I’m designing a passive greenhouse that utilizes compost piles as thermal batteries, integrated with hydroponics for a sustainable food system.

## 🎨 Software & Creative Development

*   **AR Gaming:** I’m developing a *Star Trek*-inspired persistent world web app. It’s built with **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, and local LLMs, all wrapped in a stylish Art Deco frontend.
*   **Decentralized Economics:** I’m working on an AI bidding/quoting system based on the "ETHOS" framework. This project explores post-capitalist and DAO models to manage valuation and job allocation.
*   **Board Game Design:** I’ve authored a new game, *"Weave of Golden Gnomon,"* which I hope to share more about soon.
*   **Web Infrastructure:** Self-hosting continues to be a priority. I’m managing `splotch.page` (Squarespace DNS, Namecheap email) and handling DMARC/DKIM authentication personally to ensure reliability.

It’s been a busy year, and 2026 promises to be even more intense. Thank you to everyone who has collaborated, supported, and built alongside me this year.

See you at ETHDenver!
